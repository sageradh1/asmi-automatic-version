After installing docker and docker-compose: During Implementation:
If "pip install uwsgi" doesnot work then first do this:
	1. sudo apt-get install build-essential python3.6-dev
	2. pip install uwsgi


To see all the docker images in the system:
	docker images

To see all the active docker images:
	docker images ls

To see all the containers with ports and names:
	docker ps

To build an image from the project:
	1. Go to the location where there is Dockerfile
	2. docker build -t newimagename:version .

To remove image by imageid:
	docker image rm <image_id>

To remove container by container by container id:
	docker container rm <container_id>

To run the images as containers:
	docker run -p 5000:4000 -d --name newcontainername imagename:tag

To go inside the container (like ssh access):
	docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh

To see recent logs of the app inside the docker container:
	docker logs <container_id_or_name>



Some steps to for jenkins pipeline:
	1. clone the repo

	(Image cannot be removed without stopping the container)
	2. docker container stop <container_name>
	3. docker container rm <container_name>

	4. docker image rm <imagename>
	4. docker build -t <imagename>:<tag> .
	5. docker run -p 5000:4000 -d --name <container_name> <imagename>:<tag>



If you want to avoid typing sudo whenever you run the docker command, add your username to the docker group:
	sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

To apply the new group membership, log out of the server and back in, or type the following:
	su - ${USER}
You will be prompted to enter your userâ€™s password to continue.

Confirm that your user is now added to the docker group by typing:
	id -nG
	Output
	sammy sudo docker
