In window after cloning darkflow repo , we will need to setup it buy using this command:
	python setup.py build_ext --inplace
But error will come that 
	"Microsoft Visual C++ 14.00 is required. Please install build tools from ..." 	
After installing Build tools from the link ,still the error will persist in the conda environment:
To solve this problem ,run this code:
	conda install libpython m2w64-toolchain -c msys2
	For understanding, read this link :

Also you directly download .whl file and install using this .whl file as :
	pip install C:\Users\Sagar\Downloads\surprise-0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl


Also while running main command for creating video, commands like :
	flow --model cfg/yolo-new.cfg --load bin/yolo-new.weights --demo videofile.avi --gpu 1.0 
	New error will come: 
		from darkflow.cli import cliHandler
			ImportError: No module named darkflow.cli
	To solve this problem:
		pip install tensorflow==1.13.2
		or
		pip install tensorflow==1.14.0
